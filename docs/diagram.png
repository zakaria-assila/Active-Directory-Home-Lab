# Lab Diagram & Design

This document explains the lab topology and network plan.

---

## Topology
- VirtualBox running 2 VMs:
  - Windows Server (Domain Controller)
  - Windows 10 (Client)

Both VMs use two network adapters:
- Adapter 1: NAT (Internet)
- Adapter 2: Host-Only (Internal lab network)

## Network Design
### NAT (Internet)
- Used only for updates / downloads inside VMs
- Does not replace internal DNS for AD

### Host-Only (Lab Network)
- Used for domain communication (AD DS / DNS / join domain / GPO)

---

## IP Plan (Example)
- Domain Controller (DC):
  - IP: `192.168.56.10/24`
  - DNS: `192.168.56.10`
- Windows 10 Client:
  - IP: `192.168.56.20/24`
  - DNS: `192.168.56.10`

> Important: Windows 10 must use the DC as DNS to join the domain.

## Why DNS Matters in Active Directory
Active Directory depends on DNS records (SRV records) to locate:
- Domain Controllers
- LDAP services
- Kerberos authentication services

That is why the client DNS must be the Domain Controller.
